  <h3>How our training works</h3>
  <p class="darkp">Every year in Ireland over 20,000 dogs are surrendered to the pound or put to sleep because of  behavioural problems.  Many of these problems are caused by a lack of training.  Dogs are not disposable and we hope to help in reducing these numbers by providing a suitable environment at our classes to enable you and your dog to learn together and have a happy future.  “You can teach an old dog new tricks!”

Our classes are structured taking into consideration  your dog’s age and breed, learning ability and level of existing training.Furry friends specialise in teaching your dog good behaviour, rehabilitation of dogs 
that have come from traumatic backgrounds, socialising dogs with other dogs,Our service includes picking up your dog or cat and returning when you are home. We have a specialised spa area where dogs can be groomed, we have a 
heated pool on site so your dog can enjoy swimming and a climbing jungle.</p>
